\chapter{L1's effect on prosodic properties of accented speech}
\label{l1_supraseg}

\section{Introduction}

The previous chapter applies the proposed methodology for accentedness perception to pronunciation based segmental features, and proves that integrating L1 pronunciation information by extracting pronunciation scores of accented English speech with L1 acoustic model can improve the prediction accuracy of accentedness perception. This chapter will focus on applying the same methodology to speech prosodic features to study whether L1 prosodic patterns affect the perception of accentedness. As mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:methodology}, durational rhythmic features will be used as proxy of speech prosody. The methods and analysis of results are almost the same as chapter \ref{l1_seg}. Details will be introduced in following sections.

\section{Methods}

Chapter \ref{sec:methodology} describes the procedure to extract durational rhythmic features. The extracted rhythmic features for native L1, accented L2 speech and native L2 are represented with $\mathbf{x_{L1}}$, $\mathbf{X_{acc}}$ and $\mathbf{x_{L2}}$ respectively. Note that $\mathbf{x_{L1}}$ and $\mathbf{x_{L2}}$ are vectors because they are the average of features extracted from multiple speech recordings. These three sets of features are converted to accent related features by taking the absolute difference between $\mathbf{x_{L1}}$ and $\mathbf{X_{acc}}$ and $\mathbf{x_{L2}}$ and $\mathbf{X_{acc}}$. $\left| \mathbf{x_{L2}}-\mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$ represent the difference between the rhythmic patterns of accented speech and target L2 speech, while $\left| \mathbf{x_{L1}}- \mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$ represents the difference between the rhythmic patterns of accented speech and speaker's L1 speech. Here, the subtraction is broadcasted to every row of $\mathbf{X_{acc}}$ to get the contrastive information for each speaker with accent.

The first analysis is the correlation analysis between speech prosodic features and accentedness scores averaged on 13 annotators. Similarity, the PCC is calculated between every features of the 18-dimensional feature vectors in a language-dependent way. The procedure is different from previous chapter observing that the feature dimension is higher than pronunciation features. Thus, only the top-12 features with highest PCC with accentedness scores are shown for each language together with the p-values (lower p-value stands for more statistically significant correlation).

Same multiple regression analysis is done except that the number of input features is changed to 18. Downsampling is not used since it does not help for German speakers. Thus, for each language, multiple regression analysis is conducted between 18-dimensional speech rhythmic measurements and accentedness  scores of 30 speakers. Specifically, $\left| \mathbf{x_{L2}}-\mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$ is used as the baseline model which only takes the difference of speech rhythmic patterns between accented speech and L2 into consideration. Then, $\left| \mathbf{x_{L1}}- \mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$ can be combined into the baseline feature set to model the distance between accented speech and L1 on suprasegmental feature space. Finally, input to the baseline model is a 18-dimensional feature vector, and adding L1-related information result in a 36-dimensional feature vector.

As in chapter \ref{l1_seg}, the input feature vectors are first normalized with mean and standard deviation on each dimension. Then, a feature selector based on univariate regression test is applied to select the most predictable features. Ridge regression is used to learn the relationship between input features and accentedness score. The same leave-one-speaker-out CV is employed to evaluate the performance on accentedness prediction. Hyperparameters including number of features selected and strength of 2-norm regularization in ridge regression are tuned to achieve the best CV performance. PCC and MAE are reported language dependently. To better illustrate the process, figure \ref{fig:l1_supraseg_diagram} shows the whole procedure of multiple regression analysis.

In figure \ref{fig:supraseg_bar}, PCCs together with p-values between two sets of speech rhythmic features and accentedness scores of four different foreign languages are presented. German speakers are the from the downsampled subsets with 18 speakers. There is no downsampling for French speakers because the correlation coefficients are not affected by the non-uniform distribution of accentedness scores. Feature names on X-axis are abbreviations: per\{V,C,Syl\} represents the percentage of durations of vowels, consonants and syllables, avg\{V,C,Syl\} represents the average durations, std\{V,C,Syl\} represents the standard deviation of durations, Vacro\{V,C,Syl\} represents the mean-normalizd standard deviation of durations, rPVI\{V,C,Syl\} represents the Raw PVI of durations and nPVI\{V,C,Syl\} represents the Normalized PVI) of durations. Several interesting observations can be summarized:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Except for German speakers, rhythmic features of other three languages all have relatively high correlation coefficients ($>$0.6) with accentedness scores. This can be attributed to the similarity of rhythmic patterns between English and German (as shown in figure \ref{fig:rhythmic_mds} and table \ref{table:conf_rhythmic}, also in the study by \cite{li2014l2}). It becomes hard to use rhythmic features to differentiate between mild and strong accent when the rhythmic patterns of L1 is already very close to L2.
\item As shown in previous chapter, the most predictable features extracted with L1 acoustic models have opposite correlation with accentedness scores compared to features extracted with L2 acoustic models. However, for rhythmic features, it can be found that most features of both $\left| \mathbf{x_{L2}}-\mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$ and $\left| \mathbf{x_{L1}}- \mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$ are positively correlated with accentedness scores (except for German speakers). Only a few dimensions of $\left| \mathbf{x_{L1}}- \mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$ have negative correlation with accentedness scores. This indicates that for some speakers, values of feature dimensions in $\mathbf{X_{acc}}$ are not within the range from values of $\mathbf{x_{L2}}$ to values of $\mathbf{x_{L2}}$ in corresponding dimensions, while values on some feature dimensions are between the values in L1 and L2. This is also observed in the study by \cite{white2007calibrating}. This observation is consistent with the founds in \citep{li2014l2} where the authors believe that for speech rhythm acquisition there is a multisystemic model of L2 rhythm acquisition and both transferred L1 knowledge and universal effects independent of L1 played a role.
\item For languages that have high correlation coefficients, it can be found that the average durations features and PVI features are the most correlated ones. This is also consistent with studies by \cite{ordin2015acquisition} where they show the different rhythmic feature values in different proficiency levels: beginners, intermediate and advanced, in spite that they did not provide correlation coefficients between rhythmic feature values and how strong the accent is.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results of multiple regression analysis}

During the experiment, it was found that For French and Mandarin, using feature set [$\left| \mathbf{x_{L2}}-\mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$, $\left| \mathbf{x_{L2}}-\mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$-$\left| \mathbf{x_{L1}}- \mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$] as the way to integrate L1 information gave the best performance of leave-one-speaker-out CV; for Spanish and German, feature set [$\left| \mathbf{x_{L2}}-\mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$, $\left| \mathbf{x_{L1}}- \mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$] gave the best performance. Since for French and Mandarin, using [$\left| \mathbf{x_{L2}}-\mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$, $\left| \mathbf{x_{L1}}- \mathbf{X_{acc}} \right|$] can also achieve better performance than the baseline model, the difference of the best feature sets across languages is probably due to different speech prosody patterns.
In table \ref{table:supraseg_pred}, both the PCCs and MAEs between model predicted accentedness and human annotated accentedness for 4 groups of speakers are presented. The results for German speakers are based on the 18 speakers after downsampling (same as chapter \ref{l1_seg}). However, there is no downsampling for French speakers, because without downsampling, the performance on French speakers is already satisfied. There is consistent improvement when adding L1 rhythmic patterns based features for all 4 L1s. These results show that there is benefit to model performance consistently and across all four languages after adding features from contrastive information with L1 rhythmic patterns. It proves that the rhythmic contrastive information between accented speech and L1 can provide extra information for accentedness prediction. This is also despite the fact that the annotators know little about the acoustic properties of the speakers' L1s.

\end{table}

In order to show that features extracted with L1 rhythmic patterns really helps with predicting accentedness scores, in table \ref{table:supraseg_feat_sel} L1 rhythmic patterns based features that are selected to predict accentedness scores are showed. Since the multiple regression analyses are done language-dependently, different sets of features are selected for different languages, and the number of features selected for each language is also presented in the table. It can be found that for French and Spanish speakers, the durational measurements of L1 consonants and syllables are more often selected, while for Mandarin speakers the durational measurements of L1 vowels are more import features. The study by \cite{li2014l2} compared durational measurements of Mandarin accented English and native English. They showed that vocalic rhythmic measurements can well discriminate Mandarin learners at different proficiency levels. For French and Spanish speakers, there are no studies showing the progressive change of consonantal and syllable rhythmic measurements along proficiency levels. The results are reasonable considering both French and Spanish are syllable-timed languages while English is stress-timed languages. For German speakers, L1-related vocalic, consonantal and syllabic measurements are all important for accentedness prediction. The results of the multiple regression analysis further validate the first hypothesis in chapter \ref{introduction}.

\section{Discussion}

This chapter shows that the speech prosodic properties transferred from L1 can also help deciding how strong the foreign accent of L2 learners is . This conforms with previous studies, where the authors show the L1's effect on L2 prosody acquisition \citep{rasier2007prosodic,stockmal2005measures,white2007calibrating,li2014l2,ordin2015acquisition}. However, based on the correlation analysis in figure \ref{fig:supraseg_bar}, on most feature dimensions, it does not indicate that if the rhythmic property on that dimension is further from L1, the foreign accent is milder. This is in contrast to the results in table \ref{table:seg_corr}. The first possible reason is that while previous studies show the effect of L1 on L2 rhythmic pattern acquisition, there are also obvious universal effect that are independent of L1. For example, the study \cite{ordin2015acquisition} showed that the PVI measurements of English speech produced by French speakers can be even higher than native English speakers given that English speech has much higher PVI measurements than French speech. The second possible reason is that all the rhythmic measurements in this study are based on automatic forced alignment. For speakers with not very strong accent, there will be much fewer forced-alignment errors. However, for speakers with very strong accent, the forced-alignment results may not be very accurate. This will also affect the correlation analysis between features and accentedness scores.

There are also some interesting implications combining the findings in this chapter and chapter \ref{l1_seg}. Compared to the results in chapter \ref{l1_seg}, for German and Mandarin speakers, using only segmental pronunciation based features can better predict accentedness scores than using only suprasegmental rhythmic features; while for French and Spanish, the suprasegmental rhythmic features perform better. Based on the language differential analysis presented in chapter \ref{literature}, where it shows the relative distances of different L1s to English on both phonetic space and rhythmic space, the results suggest the relative contribution of segmental and suprasegmental acoustic characteristics to the perception of foreign accent for different L1s. For example, German and English have very similar rhythmic patterns, thus segmental measurements characterizing phoneme pronunciation can better discriminate speakers with strong and weak foreign accent. Mandarin is far to English on both phonetic and prosodic subspaces, and the results indicates that for native English speakers, the pronunciation of English phonemes is more decisive to determine the accentedness. Spanish and French are all syllable-timed languages, thus native English speakers attribute the foreign accent of Spanish and French speakers more to suprasegmental inaccuracy than to segmental inaccuracy.
In contrast to previous studies using phonological properties transplantation to investigate the relative importance of segmental and suprasegmental in accentedness perception, this study provide a new way to look at the same problem with the advantage that this method can provide quantitative analysis. This study further demonstrates that the relative importance of segmental and suprasegmental features to the perception of foreign accent may vary according to accented speaker's L1 background, and the variation is due to the contrastive patterns between L1 and L2 in segmental and suprasegmental feature spaces. These findings support the second hypothesis in \ref{introduction}, which claims that ``phonological properties in different subspaces (phonetic or prosodic) of accented speech produced by speakers from different L1 backgrounds will have distinct contribution to perceived accentedness''.

This study shows that with extra speaker's L1 information, the perception of accentedness can be better modeled compared to only using the deviation from native L2. At first thought, this is against intuition, especially considering the annotators in this study do not know the identification of the speakers's L1, neither can speak those L1s. However, previous study \citep{yuan2010perception} has shown that the accentedness perception of non-native speech by non-native L2 speakers has preference over L1 backgrounds. In the study, eight Mandarin judges who were considered as experienced English speakers were asked to rate the accentedness of speakers speaking eight different L1s. The results showed that Mandarin judges tended to underestimate the accentedness of Cantonese and Mandarin speakers the most, followed by German, Japanese and Vietnamese speakers, and French, Spanish and Russian speakers the least. The authors suggested that structural similarities or differences between the L1 languages of the speakers and the listeners play an important role in the listeners' perception of accentedness. \cite{flege1995factors} reviewed the factors that affecting the perception of accentedness by native L2 speakers. However, since degree of foreign accent is originally defined as the native L2 speaker's perception of deviations from a pronunciation norm that a listener attributes to the
talker not speaking the target language natively \citep{mccullough2013acoustic}, there is no way to study if native L2 speakers have preference depending on the phonological differences and similarities between L1 and L2. This study tends to believe that the difference or similarities on specific phonological dimensions between L1 and L2 play a decisive role in accentedness perception. This effect could vary across speakers (as concluded by \cite{major1987model} that the amount of L1's influence decreased as learners become more proficient in L2, and this behavior may vary for different learners) instead of simply decided by the distance between averaged L1 phonological patterns and averaged L2 phonological patterns. Chapter \ref{discussion} will take Mandarin speakers as an example to show the effect of L1 on both phonetic and prosodic properties of accented speech.
