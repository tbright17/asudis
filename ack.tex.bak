This dissertation would not have been possible without the support of my advisors, committee members, colleagues, family and friends.

Foremost, I would express my sincerest gratitude to my advisors, Dr. Visar Berisha and Dr. Julie Liss for their continuous encouragement and support during my PhD studies. Dr. Visar Berisha has mentored me to design good research ideas and develop solutions to solve them. His openness to diverse thoughts has helped me become a real researcher. Dr. Julie Liss has taught me the correct scientific way of doing research in a new area. They are the best advisors I have ever worked with.

I would also like to thank Dr. Yi Zhou. Thanks for being my committee member and providing helpful advice and inspiring ideas on being a good researcher.

Great thanks to all my labmates during my time at ASU for their assistance and companionship. Thanks to Dr. Beatriz Barragan, Aishwarya Pratap Singh and Anna Grabek for their help in the data collection part of this dissertation. Special thanks to Dr. Alan Wisler, with the companion of whom I spent the first few years in the lab.

The most important part of my PhD study is my wife Yishan Jiao. Having been working in the same lab and with the same supervisors for 7 years, we prove that $1 + 1 > 2$ when a couple studies the same field. Thanks for her companionship in life and inspiration in work.

Thanks to my parents who give as much support as they can to make it possible for me pursuing the commitment throughout my student career. The school teaches me knowledge, and they teach me the rule of life.

This dissertation is also in loving memory of my grandmother who left me one year ago. She is illiterate but her love makes me feel the vitality for life.
