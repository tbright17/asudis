Much evidence has shown that first language (L1) plays an important role in the formation of L2 phonological system during the second language (L2) learning process. This combines with the fact that different L1s have quite different phonological patterns to indicate the diverse L2 learning outcomes for speakers from different L1 backgrounds. Usually, accented speech is investigated with either segmental (short-term speech measurements on phoneme level) or suprasegmental (long-term speech measurements on word- or sentence-level) measurements. In this dissertation, it is hypothesized that the phonological distance between accented speech and speaker's L1 are negatively correlated with perceived accentedness. Moreover, the phonological properties in segmental and suprasegmental feature space of accented speech produced by speakers from distinct L1s will have different correlational relationship with accentedness score.

To test the hypotheses, this study comes up with a computational model to analyze the accented speech properties in both segmental and suprasegmental feature space. The core parts of this computational model are feature extraction schemes to extract pronunciation and prosody representation of accented speech based on existing techniques in automatic speech recognition field. Correlation analysis on both segmental and suprasegmental feature space is done to look into the L1's influence on accentedness perception for different L1s. Multiple regression analysis is employed to investigate how the L1's effect impacts the perception of foreign accent perception and how accented speech produced by speakers from different L1s behaves distinctly on segmental and suprasegmental feature spaces. Results unveil the potential application of the methodology in this study to provide quantitative analysis of accented speech and extend current studies in L2 learning theory to large scale. Practically, this study further shows that the computational model proposed in this study can benefit automatic accentedness evaluation system by adding features related to speakers' L1s.
